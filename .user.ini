# The following settings relate to PHP config.
#

# These settings are intended for apache 2.x.  If your version of apache
# doesn't support php_value, or things like memory_limit aren't working
# as expected, then use these settings as examples for your own php.ini
# files.
# safe_mode = 0
# register_globals = 0
# magic_quotes_gpc = 0
file_uploads = 0
allow_url_fopen = On

zlib.output_handler = Off
# output_handler = NULL

# If you have a large number of channels, you may need to increase
# this value to prevent PHP from running out of memory during
# searches.  The default is 64M.
memory_limit = 64M
# memory_limit = 128M
# memory_limit = 256M
# memory_limit = 512M

# If you have a large number of channels, php may timeout creating
# complex pages, so you will need to increase the amount of time
# php has to create the page. The default is 30 seconds.
max_execution_time 30
# max_execution_time 60
# max_execution_time 120

# Note: php_flag does not work in older versions of php
# php_flag output_handler = "NULL"
